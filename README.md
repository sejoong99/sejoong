# LSTM, PINN, and BERT Research Repository

Welcome to the GitHub repository where we explore the integration and application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). This repository contains the code, datasets, and documentation for our current research projects.

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to advancing the field of machine learning by exploring three significant areas: LSTM for time series prediction, PINN for incorporating physical laws into deep learning models, and BERT for natural language processing tasks.

## Project Structure

- `/lstm` - Contains all LSTM-related experiments and code.
- `/pinn` - Includes implementations and experiments using PINNs.
- `/bert` - Directory for BERT-related models and applications.

## Installation

To set up the project environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lstm-pinn-bert-research.git
cd lstm-pinn-bert-research
pip install -r requirements.txt
